# Bragi Note

Bragi Note is an AI assistant that helps you catch up, communicate clearly, and understand complex information in seconds.

## Base idea

Bragi Note is combination of three things:

### 1. Did I Miss Anything?

An AI that tells you what you missed when you were absent

#### Emotional Hook

> “I was sick / overwhelmed / busy — and now I’m lost.”

This hits **students, employees, parents, remote workers, freelancers, and managers**.
Everyone fears being _left behind_.

### What It Does (Very Simple)

User uploads Or Extension reviews:

- A meeting transcript **OR**
- A Slack / WhatsApp chat export **OR**
- A class recording transcript

The app returns:

1. **What changed while you were gone**
2. **Decisions made**
3. **Actions you need to take**
4. **Deadlines you must not miss**

### 2. Say It Better

Fixes emotionally risky messages before you send them

#### Problem

People send or extension reviews:

- Angry emails
- Passive-aggressive Slack messages
- Emotionally bad texts

They regret it later.

#### Solution

Paste your message → select intent:

- “Calm”
- “Professional”
- “Kind but firm”
- “De-escalate conflict”

AI rewrites it **without changing meaning**.

#### Emotional Pull

> “I don’t want to ruin this relationship.”

This works for:

- Work
- Relationships
- Customer support
- Managers

### 3. Explain It Like I’m Stressed

Turns complex text into calming, human explanations

#### The Problem

People receive:

- Bank emails
- Legal notices
- Medical reports
- Academic feedback

They panic.

#### The Solution

Paste text → AI explains it:

- Calmly
- Simply
- With “What this means for you”

#### Emotional Trigger

> Fear of not understanding something important.
