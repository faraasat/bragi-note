Please review the @/docs/base-idea.md, ponder on it, and think it out clearly. Write two files.

- docs/idea.md: very comprehensive idea expanding this base idea.
- docs/technologies.md: technology details and project structure.

---

Please also include Kestra (Orchestrate pipelines and manage multi-step workflows) in @/docs/base-idea.md, @/docs/idea.md, @/docs/technologies.md and you will fit Kestra in the idea.

After you are done with all above, please write the detailed mvp under docs/mvp.md and also include all the technologies where they are being used based on @/docs .

---

Now continue building the application using instructions in @/docs. Also, rather than adding files manually for next.js use cli command and make a scalable architecture.
