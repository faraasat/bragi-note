## 1. Did I Miss Anything? (Catch-Up Assistant)

### The Deep Problem

Modern work and life create constant information streams. Missing even a short period—due to illness, vacation, focused work, or life circumstances—creates anxiety and productivity loss. The fear isn't just about missing information; it's about:

- **Social anxiety**: Being seen as "out of the loop"
- **Professional risk**: Missing deadlines or critical decisions
- **Cognitive load**: The exhausting work of reading through hundreds of messages
- **Imposter syndrome**: Feeling like everyone else is "in the know"

### Target Users

1. **Remote Workers & Distributed Teams**

   - Multiple time zones create constant "missed conversations"
   - Async communication means missing context regularly
   - Fear of appearing disengaged when actually just in a different timezone

2. **Students**

   - Missing classes due to illness, mental health days, or scheduling conflicts
   - Difficulty catching up on lecture content and class discussions
   - Anxiety about asking "what did I miss?"

3. **Managers & Leaders**

   - Can't attend every meeting but need to stay informed
   - Need to understand team dynamics and concerns
